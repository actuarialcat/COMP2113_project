## Game description with basic game rules

The game we decided to develop is "魔塔". It is fixed-values RPG with fixed battle result, fixed enemy and fixed rescources such that every same decision will always results in same outcome. However, An extra new gamemode willbe develped with random elements to make the gamemode more "roguelike".

In the game, you will control the champion who attempts to challenge a magical tower. Your goal is to climb to the top to defeat the final boss in order to save the world. The tower is full of dangerous monsters that block your way to the top. You have to battle against them and they will deal damage to you. If your health drop to zero, you will die. Luckily, the tower is also full of strategic resources to help you getting stronger and win the game.
